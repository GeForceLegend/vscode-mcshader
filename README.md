# vscode-mcshader

vscode-mcshader is a new [Language Server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) based on [Strum355/mcshader-lsp](https://github.com/Strum355/mcshader-lsp/), but rewrites the server with [tower-lsp](https://github.com/ebkalderon/tower-lsp). This repo is WIP and lacks many features that already existing in Strum355/mcshader-lsp.

If you are interested in what I have done before rewrite it with tower-lsp, you can find them in [GeForceLegend/mcshader-lsp/file-system-rewrite](https://github.com/GeForceLegend/mcshader-lsp/tree/file-system-rewrite)
